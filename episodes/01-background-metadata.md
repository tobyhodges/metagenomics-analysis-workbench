# Background  
A metagenomics study is one in which we study the genetic composition of various
species that coexist in a defined and preferably closed space. Examples of a closed
space are parts of the human body, 

## What is cuatro Cienegas

Cuatro Cienegas is an oasis in the mexican desert that can be a model for a 
[lost world](https://elifesciences.org/articles/38278).  Cuatro Cienegas shows
high content of sulphur and magnesium but little phosphorus and nutrients, conditions 
that resemble the ones found in the ancient seas. Some of the few live stromatolite
can be found at the lagoons of the Basin.  
  
## Shotgun and Amplicons    
A metagenomic study goes from the sampling design to the statistical analysis of the data sequenced. 
Mainly, two types of studies are carried out: amplicons and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) or shotgun. 
In amplicon studies, a region typical of a community of microorganisms is amplified and sequenced, 
for example the hypervariable regions of 16S in Bacteria, or ITS in Fungi.  In shotgun, random fragments 
of all genomes of all organisms in the sample are amplified and sequenced. Which is the most suitable? 
That depends on the question of the study.

## Data 
  - The data we are going to use are part of an 
  [study about responses of a microbial community to nutrient enrichment](https://elifesciences.org/articles/49816)
  led by Jordan Okie in cuatro Cienegas. 
   
   - The study traces the genomic traits that madiated responses to nutrient enrichment
   in microbial communities in an oligotrophic, phosphorus-deficient pond
   from Cuatro Cienegas Basin (CCB), Mexico.
   
  - Results indicate that traits such as mean bacterial genome size, GC content, 
  total number of tRNA genes, total number of rRNA genes, and codon usage bias in 
  ribosomal protein sequences were all higher in the fertilized treatment.  
  
  - Metagenomic communities composition change in the control vs the 
  fertilized environment, where α proteobacteria seems to be more abundant.
  
  - Raw sequence data and metadata have been submitted to the NCBI Sequence Read 
  Archive, accessible through BioProject 
  [PRJEB22811](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=PRJEB22811)
  
  - Other [Cuatro Cienegas datasets](https://www.mg-rast.org/mgmain.html?mgpage=search&search=cuatro%20cienegas)    
  have been generated by [Valeria souza](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valeria_Souza_Saldivar) group
  and can be found at MG-RAST database. 
  

> ## Metagenomic databases
>
> [MG-RAST](https://www.mg-rast.org/index.html?stay=1) is one metagenomic database, there are also 
> [MGnify](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/), 
> [Marine Metagenomics Portal](https://mmp.sfb.uit.no/), 
> [Terrestrial Metagenome DB](https://webapp.ufz.de/tmdb/)  
> and the [GM Repo](https://gmrepo.humangut.info/home).
