## Cloud pipelines can be web or command-line based
The cloud is that place where our files lives outside from our local computers. 
There are web and command line cloud services. Through this lesson we will run a 
full example using the command line, nevertheless there are also metagenomic web 
services available. For example, MG Rast is an on line metagenomic plataform where 
you can upload your raw data with its corresponding metadata and obtain a full run
of their pipeline. MgRAST is a great resource as a public repository for your datasets. 
Although command line workflows are more flexible and adaptable to individual needs, 
automatized web servers can give us a preliminar idea of the content of our data. 
Cuatro cienegas data used in this tutorial are available at MG RAST 
as [mgp96823](https://www.mg-rast.org/mgmain.html?mgpage=project&project=mgp96823). 

## Cuatro cienegas in MgRAST  
Lets explore some of the MgRAST results to our data. First we can see the metabolic content
of our data in a metabolic piechart. Since our Cuatro Cienegas data come from a shotgun experiment, 
the distribution of the metaboliccontent of its genes can be known, even without knowin from which 
taxonomical lineage those genes are comming. Here it is shown that the genetic material of 
this sample is mainly devoted to metabolism.

</a>

After metabolic features, there is some information about the taxonomixal distribution of the 
sample. First we can see that according to MgRAST the predominant taxonomic lineage of this sample is bacteria.

 And the most abundant taxon is *Erythrobacter*.

</a>

Going deeply in taxonomy, we can see that the mos abundant phylum is Proteobacteria.

## AWS is a command line cloud server. 
The machine that you are going to use is provided by amazon web services, it is equiped with all 
command line metagenomic tools needed fot this workshop. Lets practice log in into this service and 
copy files from your local computer to your remote instance of AWS.  

~~~
$ ssh dcuser@ec2-3-238-253-45.compute-1.amazonaws.com 
~~~
{: .bash}

Welcome to Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.13.0-48-generic x86_64)                                                                                                     * 
Documentation:  https://help.ubuntu.com/

{: .output}

You can ask the remote AWS machine to print working directory with `pwd` .
~~~
$ pwd 
~~~
{: .bash}
  
And it will will show you that you are in dcuser.  
~~~
$ /home/dcuser  
~~~
{: .output}

Data have been preloaded for you but they are compressed,
please decompress them using `tar` command.  
~~~
$ tar -xzf ~/mgdata.tar.gz 
~~~
{: .bash}  

To log out from your remote machine you can use `exit`.  
~~~
$ exit
~~~
{: .bash}

If you now ask the terminal to print the working directory with `pwd` 
it will show some local directory in your local computer. 
You can copy files from you local to your remote machine and viceversa. 
A general guideline using the command secure copy (`scp`) would be as follows: 
~~~
$ scp <where is the file> <where you want the file to be>  
~~~
{: .output}  

For example, you have the metadata file `MGRAST_MetaData_JP.xlsx` in your remote machine. 
This file is located at the directory `/home/dcuser/dc_workshop/metadata/`.  To copy this file
into our local machine lets use `scp` command. 

~~~
$ scp dcuser@ec2-3-238-253-45.compute-1.amazonaws.com:/home/dcuser/dc_workshop/metadata/MGRAST_MetaData_JP.xlsx .
~~~
{: .data}  

~~~
MGRAST_MetaData_JP.xlsx                          100%   53KB 164.8KB/s   00:00  
~~~
{: .output}

>  You can find metagenomic data in your AWS remote instance   
> located at /home/dcuser/dc_workshop/assembly/JP4D.fasta

>> MgRAST will ask you for a metadata file and genomic data. 
>>
>> The metadata file has been previously downloaded in this lesson.
