- "Each episode's title must include a title, time estimates, motivating questions, lesson objectives, and key points."
- "Episodes should not use sub-titles or HTML layout."
- "Code blocks can have the source, regular output, or error class."
- "Special sections are formatted as blockquotes that open with a level-2 header and close with a class identifier."
- "Special sections may be callouts or challenges; other styles are used by the template itself."

A lesson consists of one or more episodes,
each of which has:

*   a [YAML][yaml] header containing required values
*   some teachable content
*   some exercises

The diagram below shows the internal structure of a single episode file

## Assembling reads



{% raw %}
    [link text]({{ page.root }}{% link _episodes/dd-subject.md %})
{% endraw %}

i.e., use [Jekyll's tag link](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/#links) and the name of the file.

MEGAHIT is a NGS de novo assembler for assembling large and complex metagenomics data in a 
time- and cost-efficient manner.  

~~~
    ./megahit -1 SAMPLE_1.fastq  -2 SAMPLE_2.fastq  -m 0.5  -t 12  -o megahit_result
~~~
{: .source}


The class specified at the bottom using an opening curly brace and colon,
the class identifier with a leading dot,
and a closing curly brace.
The [template]({{ site.template_repo }}) provides three styles for code blocks:



~~~
.output: ls megahit_result/final.contigs.fa
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
.error: error messages.
~~~
{: .error}


`.language-bash`: Bash shell commands:

~~~
echo "Hello World"
~~~
{: .language-bash}


## Special Blockquotes

We use blockquotes to group headings and text
rather than wrapping them in `div` elements.
in order to avoid confusing [Jekyll][jekyll]'s parser
(which sometimes has trouble with Markdown inside HTML).
Each special blockquote must started with a level-2 header,
but may contain anything after that.
For example,
a callout is formatted like this:

~~~
> ## Callout Title
>
> text
> text
> text
>
> ~~~
> code
> ~~~
> {: .source}
{: .callout}
~~~
{: .source}

(Note the empty lines within the blockquote after the title and before the code block.)
This is rendered as:

> ## Callout Title
>
> text
> text
> text
>
> ~~~
> code
> ~~~
> {: .source}
{: .callout}

The [lesson template]({{ site.template_repo }}) defines styles
for the following special blockquotes:

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6" markdown="1">

> ## `.callout`
>
> An aside or other comment.
{: .callout}

> ## `.challenge`
>
> An exercise.
{: .challenge}

> ## `.checklist`
>
> Checklists.
{: .checklist}



> ## `.keypoints`
>
> Key points of an episode.
{: .keypoints}

  </div>
  <div class="col-md-6" markdown="1">

> ## `.objectives`
>
> Episode objectives.
{: .objectives}

> ## `.prereq`
>
> Prerequisites.
{: .prereq}

> ## `.solution`
>
> Exercise solution.
{: .solution}

> ## `.testimonial`
>
> A laudatory quote from a user.
{: .testimonial}

  </div>
</div>

Note that `.challenge` and `.discussion` have the same color but different icons.
Note also that one other class, `.quotation`,
is used to mark actual quotations
(the original purpose of the blockquote element).
This does not add any styling,
but is used to prevent the checking tools from complaining about a missing class.

Most authors will only use `.callout`, `.challenge`, and `.prereq`,
as the others are automatically generated by the template.
Note that `.prereq` is meant for describing things
that learners should know before starting this lesson;
setup instructions do not have a particular style,
but are instead put on the `setup.md` page.

Note also that solutions are nested inside exercises as shown below:

> ## Challenge Title `.challenge`
>
> This is the body of the challenge.
>
> ~~~
> it may include some code
> ~~~
> {: .source}
>
> > ## Solution
> >
> > This is the body of the solution.
> >
> > ~~~
> > it may also include some code
> > ~~~
> > {: .output}
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}
