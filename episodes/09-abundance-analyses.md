## Explore our samples at specific taxonomic levels
 
With the taxonomic assignment information that we obtained from Kraken we have measured diversity, and we have visualized the taxa inside each sample with
 Krona and Pavian, but Phyloseq allows us to make this visualization in a more flexible and personalized manner. So now we will take advantage of Phyloseq to make abundance plots of the taxa in our samples.

We will start our exploration at the Phylum level. In order to group all the OTUs that have the same taxonomy at a certain taxonomic rank,
we will use the function `tax_glom()`. 

~~~
> percentages_glom <- tax_glom(percentages, taxrank = 'Phylum')
> View(percentages_glom@tax_table@.Data)

  taxonomic information of each of the OTUs inside the three samples. Here, 
  we can see how only the Phylum column has information, leaving the other 
  taxonomic levels blank." />

Another phyloseq function is `psmelt()`, which melts phyloseq objects into a `data.frame` 
to manipulate them with packages like `ggplot2` and `vegan`.
~~~
> percentages_df <- psmelt(percentages_glom)
> str(percentages_df)
~~~
{: .language-r}
~~~
'data.frame': 99 obs. of  5 variables:
 $ OTU      : chr  "1063" "1063" "1063" "2350" ...
 $ Sample   : chr  "JP4D" "JC1A" "JP41" "JP41" ...
 $ Abundance: num  85 73.5 58.7 23.8 19.1 ...
 $ Kingdom  : chr  "Bacteria" "Bacteria" "Bacteria" "Bacteria" ...
 $ Phylum   : chr  "Proteobacteria" "Proteobacteria" "Proteobacteria" "Bacteroidetes" ...
~~~
{: .output}

Now, let's create another data frame with the original data. This will help us to compare the absolute with the relative abundance and have a more complete picture of our samples.
~~~
> absolute_glom <- tax_glom(physeq = merged_metagenomes, taxrank = "Phylum")
> absolute_df <- psmelt(absolute_glom)
> str(absolute_df)
~~~
{: .language-r}
~~~
'data.frame': 99 obs. of  5 variables:
 $ OTU      : chr  "1063" "1063" "2350" "1063" ...
 $ Sample   : chr  "JP4D" "JP41" "JP41" "JC1A" ...
 $ Abundance: num  116538 41798 16964 12524 9227 ...
 $ Kingdom  : chr  "Bacteria" "Bacteria" "Bacteria" "Bacteria" ...
 $ Phylum   : chr  "Proteobacteria" "Proteobacteria" "Bacteroidetes" "Proteobacteria" ...
~~~
{: .output}

With these objects and what we have learned regarding `ggplot2`, we can proceed to compare them
with a plot. First, letÂ´s create the figure for the data with absolute abundances (*i.e* `absolute_plot` object)
~~~
> absolute_df$Phylum <- as.factor(absolute_df$Phylum) # Convert the Phylum column to the factor structure
> phylum_colors_abs<- colorRampPalette(brewer.pal(8,"Dark2")) (length(levels(absolute_df$Phylum))) # Make a color palette that has as much colors are there are phylum levels
> absolute_plot <- ggplot(data= absolute_df, aes(x=Sample, y=Abundance, fill=Phylum))+ 
    geom_bar(aes(), stat="identity", position="stack")+
    scale_fill_manual(values = phylum_colors_abs)
~~~
{: .language-r}
With the `position="stack"` command, we are telling the `ggplot` function that the values must stack each other for each of the samples. In this way, we will 
have all of our different categories (OTUs) stacked in one bar and not each in a separate one. 
For more info [position_stack](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/position_stack.html) 

Next, we will create the figure for the representation of the relative abundance data, and ask
RStudio to show us both plots thanks to the `|` function from the library `patchwork`:
~~~
> percentages_df$Phylum <- as.factor(percentages_df$Phylum)
> phylum_colors_rel<- colorRampPalette(brewer.pal(8,"Dark2")) (length(levels(percentages_df$Phylum)))
> relative_plot <- ggplot(data=percentages_df, aes(x=Sample, y=Abundance, fill=Phylum))+ 
    geom_bar(aes(), stat="identity", position="stack")+
    scale_fill_manual(values = phylum_colors_rel)
> absolute_plot | relative_plot
~~~
{: .language-r}

<a href="{{ page.root }}/fig/03-09-02.png">
  <img src="{{ page.root }}/fig/03-09-02.png" alt="A two-part plot contrasting 
  the absolute versus the relative abundance of the three samples. On the right 
  side, we can see how each of the bars has its own height, making it difficult 
  to compare the information between samples. Whereas, the right side shows 
  three bars with the same height after the abundance was transformed to 
  percentage inside of each sample." />
</a>
<em> Figure 2. Taxonomic diversity of absolute and relative abundance. <em/>

At once, we can denote the difference between the two plots and how processing the data can 
enhance the display of important results. However, it is noticeable that we have too many taxa
to adequately distinguish the color of each one of them, less of the ones that hold the greatest
abundance. In order to change that, we will use the power of data-frames and R. We will change
the identification of the OTUs whose relative abundance is less than 0.2%:
~~~
> percentages_df$Phylum <- as.character(percentages_df$Phylum) # Return the Phylum column to be of type character
> percentages_df$Phylum[percentages_df$Abundance < 0.5] <- "Phyla < 0.5% abund."
> unique(percentages_df$Phylum)
~~~
{: .language-r}
~~~
[1] "Proteobacteria"    "Bacteroidetes"     "Actinobacteria"    "Firmicutes"        "Cyanobacteria"    
[6] "Planctomycetes"    "Verrucomicrobia"   "Phyla < 0.5 abund"
~~~
{: .output}

Let's ask R to display the figures again by re-running our code:
~~~
> percentages_df$Phylum <- as.factor(percentages_df$Phylum)
> phylum_colors_rel<- colorRampPalette(brewer.pal(8,"Dark2")) (length(levels(percentages_df$Phylum)))
> relative_plot <- ggplot(data=percentages_df, aes(x=Sample, y=Abundance, fill=Phylum))+ 
  geom_bar(aes(), stat="identity", position="stack")+
  scale_fill_manual(values = phylum_colors_rel)
> absolute_plot | relative_plot

## Going further, let's take an interesting lineage and explore it thoroughly

As we have already reviewed, Phyloseq offers a lot of tools to manage and explore data. Let's take a 
look deeply at a function that we already use, but now with guided exploration. The `subset_taxa` command is used to extract specific lineages from a stated taxonomic level, we have used it to get 
rid of the reads that do not belong to bacteria with `merged_metagenomes <- subset_taxa(merged_metagenomes, Kingdom == "Bacteria")`.

We are going to use it now to extract a specific phylum from our data, and explore it at a lower 
taxonomic level: Genus. We will take as an example the phylum Cyanobacteria (certainly, this is a biased
and arbitrary decision, but who does not feel attracted to these incredible microorganisms?):
~~~
> cyanos <- subset_taxa(merged_metagenomes, Phylum == "Cyanobacteria")
> unique(cyanos@tax_table@.Data[,2])
~~~
{: .language-r}
~~~
[1] "Cyanobacteria"
~~~
{: .output}

Let's do a little review of all that we saw today: **Transformation of the data; Manipulation of the 
information; and plotting**:
~~~
> cyanos_percentages <- transform_sample_counts(cyanos, function(x) x*100 / sum(x) )
> cyanos_glom <- tax_glom(cyanos_percentages, taxrank = "Genus")
> cyanos_df <- psmelt(cyanos_glom)
> cyanos_df$Genus[cyanos_df$Abundance < 10] <- "Genera < 10.0 abund"
> plot_cyanos <- ggplot(data=cyanos_df, aes(x=Sample, y=Abundance, fill=Genus))+ 
    geom_bar(aes(), stat="identity", position="stack")
> plot_cyanos
