This episode demonstrates all the features that can be used when writing a
lesson in [RMarkdown][r-markdown].

Once we know what our metagenome is made of, we can do the diversity analysis.
Here we can see the diversity α (within the group) and β (between groups)
Α Diversity: It can be measured by calculating Richness, 
Eveness Shannon diversity index, Simpson diversity index, Chao1, etc.
Diversity β: The difference (or distance) between two communities is measured. 
For example, Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, Jaccard distance or UniFrac are used.

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat,  y = price, color = cut)) +
    geom_point()

For the challenges and their solutions, you need to pay attention to where the
`>` go and where to leave blank lines. You can include code chunks in both the
instructions and solutions. For instance this:

```
> ## Challenge: Can you do it?
>
> What is the output of this command?
>
>
> ~~~
> paste("This", "new", "template", "looks", "good")
> ~~~
> {: .language-r}
>
> > ## Solution
> >
> >
> > ~~~
> > [1] "This new template looks good"
> > ~~~
> > {: .output}
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}
```

will generate this:

> ## Challenge: Can you do it?
>
> What is the output of this command?
>
>
> ~~~
> paste("This", "new", "template", "looks", "good")
> ~~~
> {: .language-r}
>
> > ## Solution
> >
> >
> > ~~~
> > [1] "This new template looks good"
> > ~~~
> > {: .output}
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}
