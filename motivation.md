## Our Mission
We make scientists and engineering more productive by teaching them basic computing skills.

## The Problem

- Surveyed 1972 scientists in 2008.
- “How do you use computers?”
- “How did you learn what you know?”


## The Problem
- Scientists spend 40% of their time building or using software.
- 55% say this figure is rising.
- *96% are mostly self-taught*.


## The Problem
- No hard data on how *well* they do things.
- But anecdotal evidence suggests “not very”.


## Our Solution
- Intensive hands-on training.
- Two full days of instruction.

## Outcomes
- 20% improvement in productivity is common.
- 10X isn't rare.


## Outcomes
- Empowers people.
- HPC, the cloud, web services, big data, ...
- Reproducible research, open science, ...


## The Details
- Materials are all open access.
- Instructors are volunteers.
- Only cost is travel and accommodation
- (but contributions to central costs are welcome).

## SOME TEMPLATE SLIDES

## With some paragraph
Pandoc is nice.

## Bullet points
- With bullet points
- And
    - even
    - nested ones
    - NB: pandoc requires a 4-space indentation
- Indeed

## A plain slide with a title
- And
- Some
- Bullet points
- And [a test link](/)


- A slide without a title.
- To test the stability of the layout.
- To check the title space is blank.


## And a long title that might go on two lines
- Is it?


## An image in the slide

Anything can follow the image, like this paragraph.

- Or
- Anything else


## An image on the left {.media-left}
